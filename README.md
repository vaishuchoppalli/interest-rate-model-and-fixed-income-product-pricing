# Interest Rate Model and Fixed Income Product Pricing


## Abstract

Interest rates have a significant role in the value of practically all derivatives. When discounting a product's present value during a problem set exercise, we frequently assume a known fixed interest rate, however, in the actual world, interest rates can fluctuate overnight, just like other products. Every financial institution needs a more precise and adaptable model to provide an appropriate price for connected products. Fixed income refers to financial securities that pay fixed interest or dividend payments to investors until the maturity date. It is an investment strategy centered on capital and income preservation, and its current value is heavily influenced by market interest rates. This project prepares me for my desired role in Portfolio Management by teaching me how to price fixed-income products and develop trading techniques.

## Further Developments

1. Data quality can be improved.
2. Volatility can be assumed to be varying.
3. Machine Learning, Kalman Filtering, time series methods can be implemented!
